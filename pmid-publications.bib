  abstract = {PURPOSE: Men with prostate cancer prefer patient-specific, quantitative assessments of longevity in shared decision making. We sought to characterize how physicians communicate the 3 components of competing risks-life expectancy (LE), cancer prognosis and treatment-related survival benefit-in treatment consultations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conversation related to LE, cancer prognosis and treatment-related survival benefit was identified in transcripts from treatment consultations of 42 men with low- and intermediate-risk disease across 10 multidisciplinary providers. Consensus of qualitative coding by multiple reviewers noted the most detailed mode of communication used to describe each throughout the consultation.
RESULTS: Physicians frequently failed to provide patient-specific, quantitative estimates of LE and cancer mortality. LE was omitted in 17% of consultations, expressed as a generalization (eg "long"/"short") in 17%, rough number of years in 31%, probability of mortality/survival at an arbitrary timepoint in 17% and in only 19% as a specific number of years. Cancer mortality was omitted in 24% of consultations, expressed as a generalization in 7%, years of expected life in 2%, probability at no/arbitrary timepoint in 40% and in only 26% as the probability at LE. Treatment-related survival benefit was often omitted; cancer mortality was reported without treatment in 38%, with treatment in 10% and in only 29% both with and without treatment. Physicians achieved "trifecta"-1) quantifying probability of cancer mortality 2) with and without treatment 3) at the patient's LE-in only 14% of consultations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often fail to adequately quantify competing risks. We recommend the "trifecta" approach, reporting 1) probability of cancer mortality 2) with and without treatment 3) at the patient's LE.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A better understanding of the relationship between the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to regional lymph nodes (LNs) and the frequency and manner of treatment failure should help design better treatment intensification strategies. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between recurrence patterns, mortality, and number of pathologically positive (+) LNs in HNSCC in 3 prospective randomized controlled trials.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a secondary analysis of 947 patients with HNSCC enrolled in RTOG 9501 (n = 410), RTOG 0234 (n = 203), and EORTC 22931 (n = 334) undergoing surgery and postoperative radiation ± systemic therapy. Multivariable models were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional relapse (LRR), and distant metastases (DM). Restricted cubic splines were used to model the nonlinear relationship between +LN number and outcomes.
RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, OS and DFS decreased with each +LN without plateau, most pronounced up to 5 +LNs (OS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.21 per +LN; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.34; P < .001; DFS: HR per +LN, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30; P < .001) and more gradually beyond this (OS: HR per +LN, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P < .001; DFS: HR per +LN, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; P < .001). In contrast to LRR risk, which increased sharply up to 5 +LNs (HR per +LN, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.50; P < .001) but plateaued beyond this (HR per +LN, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.04; P = .98), DM risk increased continuously with increasing +LNs (≤5 +LNs: HR per +LN, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20; P = .04; >5 +LNs: HR per +LN, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk resected HNSCC, increased mortality was associated with increased +LN count. LRR and DM risk both increased in parallel up to 5 +LNs, but only DM continued to increase for further +LN increases. These differing recurrence patterns can help inform design of future treatments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nodal staging systems vary substantially across solid tumors, implying heterogeneity in the behavior of nodal variables in various contexts. We hypothesized, in contradiction to this, that metastatic lymph node (LN) number is a universal and dominant predictor of outcome across solid tumors.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 1 304 498 patients in the National Cancer Database undergoing surgery between 2004 and 2015 across 16 solid cancer sites. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were constructed using restricted cubic splines to model the association between nodal number and mortality. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to derive nodal classification systems for each solid cancer based on metastatic LN count. The reproducibility of these findings was assessed in 1 969 727 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Two-sided tests were used for all statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Consistently across disease sites, mortality risk increased continuously with increasing number of metastatic LNs (P < .001 for all spline segments). Each RPA-derived nodal classification system produced multiple prognostic groups spanning a wide spectrum of mortality risk (P < .001). Multivariable models using these RPA-derived nodal classifications demonstrated improved concordance with mortality compared with models using American Joint Committee on Cancer staging in sites where nodal classification is not based on metastatic LN count. Each RPA-derived nodal classification system was reproducible in a large validation cohort for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (P < .001). High quantitative nodal burden was the single strongest tumor-intrinsic variable associated with mortality in 12 of 16 disease sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative metastatic LN burden is a fundamental driver of mortality across solid cancers and should serve as a foundation for pathologic nodal staging across solid tumors.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Lymph node (LN) involvement is an important factor in guiding adjuvant treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. Risk factors for LN involvement are fairly well-established for endometrial adenocarcinoma, but it is not as well defined whether these factors similarly predict LN positivity in less common histologies.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pathologic T1-T2 carcinosarcoma, clear cell, uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC), and mixed histologic type endometrial cancer between 2004 and 2016 undergoing primary surgery with at least 1 lymph node sampled in the National Cancer Data Base were identified. Logistic regression was performed to identify primary pathologic tumor predictors of LN positivity. Nomograms were created to predict overall, pelvic only, and paraaortic with or without pelvic LN involvement.
RESULTS: Among 11,390 patients included, 1950 (18%) were node positive. On multivariable analysis, increasing pathologic tumor stage (pT2 versus pT1a, odds ratio [OR] 3.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.15-4.18, p < 0.001), increase in tumor size per centimeter (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.10, p < 0.001), and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR 4.97, 95% CI 4.43-5.57, p < 0.001) were predictive of overall LN positivity. Relative to carcinosarcoma, both clear cell (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22-1.95, p < 0.001) and UPSC (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.48-2.02, p < 0.001) histology were significantly associated with a higher risk of LN positivity while mixed histology was not (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92-1.24, p = 0.42).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with non-endometrioid endometrial cancer, predictors of LN positivity are similar to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The nomograms provided could be helpful in making adjuvant treatment decisions for these less common histologies.},

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used the US National Cancer Database to identify patients with tumor-node-metastasis stage 3 or 4 HCC between 2017 and 2018. We performed multivariable Cox regression to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS) and logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of immunotherapy. Of the 3,990 patients treated for advanced HCC, 3,248 (81.4%) patients received chemotherapy and 742 (18.6%) patients received immunotherapy as a first-line treatment. Immunotherapy was associated with improved OS compared with chemotherapy (adjusted HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.88) after adjusting for covariates. There were racial and ethnic disparities in access to immunotherapy, with Hispanic (adjusted OR [aOR]: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.83) and Black patients (aOR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54-0.89) less likely to receive immunotherapy compared with White patients. There was a significant interaction between race-ethnicity and facility type, with higher disparity observed in nonacademic centers (interaction p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Immunotherapy was associated with improved OS compared with chemotherapy in advanced HCC. There are significant disparities in early access to immunotherapy, likely due to differential access to clinical trials and experimental therapies. A comprehensive approach to monitoring and eliminating racial-ethnic disparities in the management of advanced HCC is urgently needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of targeted and systematic biopsies during MR/US-fusion prostate biopsy improves cancer detection over either modality alone.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with disparity in detection of prostate cancer between systematic and targeted biopsies in magnetic resonance imaging positive zones.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively analyzed 171 men receiving initial MR/US fusion biopsy at our institution from 2015 to 2018.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Disparity was defined as positive targeted but negative systematic biopsy within an magnetic resonance imaging-positive zone (PIRADS 3+), or vice versa. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with disparity in detection of cancer on a per lesion basis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATION: Three hundred and fifty-five lesions were targeted. For any cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), 37 (10%) and 24 (7%) lesions were target positive/systematic negative, respectively, while 30 (8%) and 23 (6%) lesions were target negative/systematic positive. In multivariable analysis, anterior location (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.4, P = 0.007) was associated with csPCa target positive/systematic negative disparity, while higher prostate volume (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.0-1.29, P = 0.04) was associated with csPCa target negative/systematic positive disparity. Shorter distance from apex (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P = 0.02) was associated with target positive/systematic negative disparity for any cancer. Limitations included relatively limited sample size and lack of prostatectomy specimen as a gold standard.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior or apical lesion location favors better disease capture on targeted biopsies. When doing systematic-only biopsies, surgeons may consider sampling the anterior zone separately.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Prostate cancer pathological nodal staging uses a single category for all node-positive patients. We sought to improve risk stratification by creating and validating a novel pathological nodal staging system incorporating number of metastatic lymph nodes (+LNs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 118,450 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database comprised our development cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with restricted cubic splines was used to assess the nonlinear association between number of +LNs and overall mortality (OM). A novel staging system based on number of +LNs was derived by recursive partitioning analysis. The staging system was validated for prediction of OM and prostate-specific mortality in 105,568 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Discrimination was assessed via Harrell's c-index.
RESULTS: In multivariable Cox analysis, OM risk increased with higher number of +LNs up to 4 (HR 1.30 per each LN+, 95% CI 1.23-1.38), with a nonstatistically significant increase in risk (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99-1.11) beyond 4 +LN. In the development cohort, recursive partitioning analysis identified optimal cutoffs at 0 (N0: referent), 1 (N1: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.25-1.58), 2 (N2: HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.40-1.99), 3-5 (N3a: HR 2.18, 95% CI 0.84-2.60) and ≥6 (N3b: HR 3.00, 95% CI 2.37-3.79) +LNs. In the validation cohort, these groups had markedly different 10-year OM (0+ LNs, N0: 15%; 1+ LN, N1: 35%; 2+ LNs, N2: 43%; 3-5 +LNs, N3a: 52%; and ≥6 +LNs, N3b: 59%; p <0.05) and prostate-specific mortality. The novel staging system improved survival classification over current staging for node-positive patients (optimism-corrected c-index 0.669 [95% CI 0.668-0.671] vs 0.649 [95% CI 0.648-0.651]).
CONCLUSIONS: Pathological nodal staging in prostate cancer is improved with stratification by number of +LNs.},

We aimed to characterize the prevalence, correlates, and clinical impact of therapeutic underuse and delay in patients with HCC. Patients with HCC diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 were analyzed from the United States National Cancer Database. Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with no and delayed (>90 days after diagnosis) HCC treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression with landmark analysis assessed the association between therapeutic delay and overall survival (OS), accounting for immortal time bias. Of 116,299 patients with HCC, 24.2% received no treatment and 18.4% of treated patients had delayed treatment. Older age, Black, Hispanic, lower socioeconomic status, earlier year of diagnosis, treatment at nonacademic centers, Northeast region, increased medical comorbidity, worse liver dysfunction, and higher tumor burden were associated with no treatment. Among treated patients, younger age, Hispanic, Black, treatment at academic centers, West region, earlier tumor stage, and receipt of noncurative treatment were associated with treatment delays. In multivariable Cox regression with a landmark of 150 days, patients with and without treatment delays had similar OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.04) with a median survival of 33.7 vs. 32.1 months, respectively. However, therapeutic delay was associated with worse OS in patients who had tumor, nodes, and metastases (TNM) stage 1 (aHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11) or received curative treatment (aHR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18). Conclusion: One-fourth of patients with HCC receive no therapy and one-fifth of treated patients experience treatment delays. Both were associated with demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics of patients as well as facility type and region.

We used existing clinician-reported adverse event (AE) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire data from the randomized, double-blind NSABP B-35 clinical trial to explore reasons for anastrozole and tamoxifen discontinuation.
METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving therapy were randomly assigned to anastrozole or tamoxifen for 5 years. The primary outcome for this analysis was time to treatment discontinuation. AEs were collected every 6 months post-random assignment from all 3,104 participants and summarized using the Toxicity Index (TI). PRO data were collected at baseline and every 6 months from 1,194 participants. Univariate and multivariable analyses of time to treatment discontinuation were performed using Cox regression models with TIs and PROs as time-dependent covariates.
RESULTS: Of 3,046 analyzed participants, 869 (28.5%) discontinued treatment prematurely. In multivariable analysis, when both baseline PROs and on-treatment AEs were considered, thrombosis and arthralgia AEs were associated with discontinuation of both tamoxifen and anastrozole; additional AEs associated with discontinuation varied by drug. In addition, baseline pain interference, hot flashes, and unhappiness were associated with tamoxifen discontinuation (n = 589; overall Harrell's C-statistic 0.686 [95% CI, 0.640 to 0.732]); no baseline PROs were associated with anastrozole discontinuation (n = 589; overall Harrell's C-statistic 0.656 [95% CI, 0.630 to 0.681]). When only baseline PROs were examined, pain interference, hot flashes, and unhappiness were associated with shorter time to discontinuation of tamoxifen; only hot flashes were associated with discontinuation of anastrozole.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of AEs using the TI yielded important insights into reasons for discontinuation of endocrine therapy that was enhanced by the addition of PRO baseline and treatment-emergent symptoms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The addition of brachytherapy (BT) in high risk prostate cancer is supported by Level 1 evidence. Whether all high risk patients benefit from BT to the same extent is unknown. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to investigate overall survival (OS) differences between GS 8 and 9-10 treated with external beam radiation (EBRT) only or BT +/- EBRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included localized prostate adenocarcinoma definitively treated with radiation between 2004-2014. Patients were stratified into various radiation treatment groups: EBRT 7560 - 8640 cGy, EBRT 5940 - 7540 cGy, and BT +/- EBRT. All EBRT only and BT +/- EBRT patients received ADT. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess OS. Propensity score matching was used to account for differences between groups. Median survival was determined based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
RESULTS: 30,698 patients were included. On multivariable analysis among GS 8 patients, BT was associated with improved OS compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy (HR-0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.92, P = 0.002). In Gleason 9-10 BT did not result in improved OS compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy (HR- 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 - 1.05, P = 0.212). Results remained significant with propensity score matching and removing patients with medical comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: BT was associated with improved OS when compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy in GS 8, but not in Gleason 9-10 disease. This hypothesis generating study suggests there may be variable benefit with BT in high risk prostate cancer patients on OS. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether the benefit of BT is similar across all high risk prostate cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Importance: Given the evolving patterns of lymph node evaluation for cutaneous melanoma, it is unclear whether the current nodal classification system will continue to accurately reflect prognosis in the modern era. Existing nodal staging for cutaneous melanoma was developed primarily for patients undergoing completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for node-positive disease and does not produce groups with continuously increasing mortality.
Objective: To develop and validate a modified nodal classification system for cutaneous melanoma.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis included 105 785 patients with cutaneous melanoma undergoing surgery and nodal evaluation from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015, in the National Cancer Database. Extent of lymph node dissection was available for patients diagnosed in 2012 and onward. Multivariable models were generated with number of positive lymph nodes modeled using restricted cubic splines. A modified nodal classification system was derived using recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). The proposed lymph node classification system was validated in 85 499 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER-18) database. Data were analyzed from April 9, 2020, to May 28, 2021.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival.
Results: Among the 105 785 patients included in the analysis (62 496 men [59.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.9 [15.5] years), number of positive lymph nodes (hazard ratio [HR] per lymph node for 0 to 2 positive lymph nodes, 2.48 [95% CI, 2.37-2-61; P < .001]; HR per lymph node for ≥3 positive lymph nodes, 1.10 [95% CI 1.07-1.13; P < .001]), clinically detected metastases (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27-1.42; P < .001), and in-transit metastases (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.34-1.65; P < .001) were independently associated with mortality. An RPA-derived system using these variables demonstrated continuously increasing mortality for each proposed lymph node classification group, with HRs of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.91) for N1a, 2.72 (95% CI, 2.58-2.86) for N1b, 3.79 (95% CI, 3.51-4.08) for N2a, 4.56 (95% CI, 4.22-4.92) for N2b, 6.15 (95% CI, 5.59-6.76) for N3a, and 8.25 (95% CI, 7.64-8.91) for N3b in the proposed system (P < .001). By contrast, the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) nodal classification system produced a more haphazard mortality profile, with HRs of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.76-1.91) for N1a, 3.81 (95% CI, 3.53-4.12) for N1b, 2.59 (95% CI, 2.30-2.93) for N1c, 2.71 (95% CI, 2.56-2.87) for N2a, 4.51 (95% CI, 4.17-4.87) for N2b, 3.44 (95% CI, 2.60-4.55) for N2c, 6.06 (95% CI, 5.51-6.67) for N3a, 8.15 (95% CI, 7.54-8.81) for N3b, and 6.90 (95% CI, 5.60-8.49) for N3c. As a sensitivity analysis, the proposed system continued to accurately stratify patients when excluding those undergoing CLND for microscopic lymph node metastases. This system was validated for overall survival and cause-specific mortality in SEER-18. Last, a new overall staging system for node-positive patients was developed by RPA and demonstrated improved concordance vs the AJCC, 8th edition system (C statistic, 0.690 [95% CI, 0.689-0.691] vs 0.666 [95% CI, 0.666-0.668]).
Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that a modified nodal classification system can accurately stratify mortality risk in cutaneous melanoma in an era of increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy without CLND and should be considered for future staging systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Graphical displays and data visualization are essential components of statistical analysis that can lead to improved understanding of clinical trial adverse event (AE) data. Correspondence analysis (CA) has been introduced decades ago as a multivariate technique that can communicate AE contingency tables using two-dimensional plots, while quantifying the loss of information as other dimension reduction techniques such as principal components and factor analysis.
METHODS: We propose the application of stacked CA using contribution biplots as a tool to explore differences in AE data among treatments in clinical trials. We defined five levels of refinement for the analysis based on data derived from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades, domains, terms and their combinations. In addition, we developed a Shiny app built in an R-package, visae, publicly available on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), to interactively investigate CA configurations based on the contribution to the explained variance and relative frequency of AEs. Data from two randomized controlled trials (RCT) were used to illustrate the proposed methods: NSABP R-04, a neoadjuvant rectal 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing radiation therapy with either capecitabine (Cape) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone with or without oxaliplatin (Oxa), and NSABP B-35, a double-blind RCT comparing tamoxifen to anastrozole in postmenopausal women with hormone-positive ductal carcinoma in situ.
RESULTS: In the R04 trial (n = 1308), CA biplots displayed the discrepancies between single agent treatments and their combinations with Oxa at all levels of AE classes, such that these discrepancies were responsible for the largest portion of the explained variability among treatments. In addition, an interaction effect when adding Oxa to Cape/5-FU was identified when the distance between Cape+Oxa and 5-FU + Oxa was observed to be larger than the distance between 5-FU and Cape, with Cape+Oxa and 5-FU + Oxa in different quadrants of the CA biplots. In the B35 trial (n = 3009), CA biplots showed different patterns for non-adherent Anastrozole and Tamoxifen compared with their adherent counterparts.
CONCLUSION: CA with contribution biplot is an effective tool that can be used to summarize AE data in a two-dimensional display while minimizing the loss of information and interpretation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent trends of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality and outcome remain unknown in the United States. We investigated the recent trends of primary liver cancer (excluding intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) mortality and HCC stage, treatment, and overall survival (OS) in the United States.
METHODS: The National Center for Health Statistics Database was analyzed to investigate the trend of primary liver cancer mortality. We analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database to assess the temporal trend of tumor size, stage, treatment, and OS of HCC. We investigated the association between HCC diagnosis year and OS using Cox regression analysis. All statistical tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS: During 2000-2018, liver cancer mortality rates increased until 2013, plateaued during 2013-2016 (annual percent change = 0.1%/y, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.1%/y to 2.4%/y, P = .92), and started to decline during 2016-2018 (annual percent change = -1.5%/y, 95% CI = -3.2%/y to 0.2%/y, P = .08). However, mortality continues to increase in American Indian and Alaska Native, individuals aged 65 years or older, and in 33 states. There was a 0.61% (95% CI = 0.53% to 0.69%, P < .001) increase in localized stage HCC and a 0.86-mm (95% CI = -1.10 to -0.62 mm, P < .001) decrease in median tumor size per year. The 1-year OS rate increased from 36.3% (95% CI = 34.3% to 38.3%) to 58.1% (95% CI = 56.9% to 59.4%) during 2000-2015, and the 5-year OS rate almost doubled from 11.7% (95% CI = 10.4% to 13.1%) to 21.3% (95% CI = 20.2% to 22.4%) during 2000-2011. Diagnosis year (per year) (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.96 to 0.97) was independently associated with OS in multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary liver cancer mortality rates have started to decline in the United States with demographic and state-level variation. With an increasing detection of localized HCC, the OS of HCC has improved over the past decades.},

Differences in their clinical features and outcomes are open for investigation in a large-scale study. We aim to investigate the differences in clinical features and outcomes between iCCA and HCC.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program 18 Database (2000-2017) was used to extract demographic and clinical features of HCC and iCCA patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with iCCA diagnosis versus HCC. Cox regression analysis was used to assess factors affecting overall survival (OS). There were 13,611 iCCA and 96,151 HCC patients. Half of iCCA (50.7%) and three quarters of HCC (76.3%) patients were male. Diagnosis in recent year, age (<50 or ≥65), female sex, non-Hispanic White race, higher income, rural area, and higher tumor burden were independently associated with iCCA diagnosis versus HCC. Patients with iCCA had worse OS than those with HCC (9 vs. 13 months; P < 0.001). However, OS was comparable between iCCA and HCC in multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.99-1.05). In subgroup analyses, iCCA was associated with better OS than HCC in patients with tumor ≥5 cm (aHR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.80-0.86), lymph node involvement (aHR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.72-0.81), distant metastasis (aHR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.73-0.79), poorly/undifferentiated tumors (aHR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.83-0.94), and those receiving noncurative treatment (aHR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93-0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical features associated with iCCA diagnosis over HCC among patients with PLC. Although iCCA patients presented at an advanced stage, OS was similar between iCCA and HCC in multivariable analysis. iCCA was associated with longer OS for subgroups with poor prognostic features.},

  abstract = {Background: While numerous factors determine prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), distant metastasis (M1) represents one of the most dire. Escalating nodal burden and aggressive histology may contribute to higher metastatic risk, but this relationship is poorly defined and challenging to anticipate. We evaluate the predictive impact of these histological features on predicting distant metastases at initial presentation. Methods: Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models of conventional and aggressive thyroid cancer variants (well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma [WDPTC], diffuse sclerosing variant [DSV], tall cell variant [TCV], poorly differentiated thyroid cancer [PDTC], and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [ATC]) identified via U.S. cancer registry data were constructed to determine associations between M1 status and quantitative nodal burden. Associations between metastatic lymph node (LN) number and M1 disease were modeled using univariate and multivariable logistic regression with interaction terms, as well as a linear continuous probability model. Results: Overall, M1 prevalence at disease presentation was 3.6% (n = 1717). When stratified by subtype, M1 prevalence varied significantly by histology (WDPTC [1.0%], DSV [2.3%], TCV [4.1%], PDTC [17.4%], ATC [38.4%] [p < 0.001]). For WDPTC, M1 prevalence escalated with metastatic LN number (0 LN+ [0.5%], 1-5 LN+ [2.0%], 6-10 LN+ [3.4%], >10 LN+ [5.5%] [p < 0.001]) and LN ratio (p < 0.001). A statistically significant interaction was observed between histology and increasing nodal burden for M1 risk. On multivariable analysis, each successive metastatic LN conferred increased M1 risk for WDPTC (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [1.05-1.08], p < 0.001) and TCVs (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07], p < 0.001). In contrast, other aggressive variants had a higher baseline M1 risk, but this did not vary based on the number of positive LN (DSV, OR 1.02 [0.95-1.10], p = 0.52; PDTC, OR 1.00 [0.98-1.02], p = 0.66; ATC, 1.00 [0.98-1.02], p = 0.97). Conclusions: Progressive nodal burden independently escalates the risk of distant metastasis in WDPTC and TCVs of PTC. Conversely, aggressive variants such as PDTC and ATC have substantial M1 risk at baseline and appear to be minimally affected by metastatic nodal burden. Consideration of these factors after surgery may help tailor clinical decision-making for treatment and surveillance. Further studies are warranted to calibrate the ideal management approach for these higher risk patient groups.},

The study aims to (1) compare overall survival after surgical resection and systemic therapy among patients with HCC and vascular invasion and (2) determine factors associated with receipt of surgical resection in a US population.
METHODS: HCC patients with AJCC clinical TNM stage 7th T3BN0M0 diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 from the National Cancer Database were analyzed. Cox and logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with overall survival and receipt of surgical resection.
RESULTS: Of 11,259 patients with T3BN0M0 HCC, 325 (2.9%) and 4,268 (37.9%) received surgical resection and systemic therapy, respectively. In multivariable analysis, surgical resection was associated with improved survival compared to systemic therapy (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.496, 95% confidence interval: 0.426-0.578) with a median survival of 21.4 and 8.1 months, respectively. Superiority of surgical resection was observed in noncirrhotic and cirrhotic subgroups and propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting adjusted analysis. Asians were more likely to receive surgical resection, whereas Charlson comorbidity ≥3, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, smaller tumor size, care in a community cancer program, and the South or West region were associated with a lower likelihood of surgical resection.
CONCLUSION: HCC patients with vascular invasion may benefit from surgical resection compared to systemic therapies. Demographic and clinical features of HCC patients and region and type of treating facility were associated with surgical resection versus systemic treatment.},

RESULTS: 33 845 were identified using the National Cancer Database. Rate of 90dPOM was 3.2%. Predictors of higher 90dPOM include older age, higher comorbidity scores, nonprivate insurance, lower income, treatment in an academic facility, higher T- and N-classification, radical excision, and presence of positive margins. On RPA, two high-risk (90dPOM > 10%) patient subsets were identified: patients ≥80 years of age with T3-4 disease and patients <80 years, with any comorbidity and T3-4, N2-3 disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a subset of patients in this cohort who are at high risk for 90dPOM. These patients may warrant additional perioperative and postoperative monitoring in addition to better preoperative assessment and screening.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minority groups. However, state-level variation in racial/ethnic disparities and temporal trends of HCC incidence remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to characterize (1) state-level racial/ethnic disparity in HCC incidence, (2) state-level temporal changes in HCC incidence, and (3) the ecological correlation between HCC incidence and obesity/physical activity levels in the USA.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Trends in HCC incidence between 2001 and 2017 were calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, and annual percent change in rates were calculated. State-level percent of obesity and level of physical activity were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the correlation among obesity, physical activity, and state-specific average annual percent change was tested by Pearson correlation coefficient. There were striking state-level racial/ethnic disparities in HCC incidence; incidence rate ratios ranged between 6.3 and 0.9 in Blacks, 6.1 and 1.7 in Asians/Pacific Islanders, 3.8 and 0.9 in Hispanics, and 6.0 and 0.9 in American Indians/Alaska Natives (compared with Whites as reference). Despite overall decreasing HCC incidence rates after 2015, HCC incidence continued increasing in 26 states over recent years. HCC incidence trends had a moderate correlation with state-level obesity (r = 0.45, P < 0.001) and a moderate inverse correlation with state-level physical activity (r = -0.40, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: There is wide state-level variation in racial/ethnic disparity of HCC incidence. There are also disparate incidence trends across states, with HCC incidence continuing to increase in over half of the states. Regional obesity and lack of physical activity have moderate correlations with HCC incidence trends, suggesting that interventions targeting these factors may help curb rising HCC incidence.},

It is unknown if there are clinical factors that predict MRI invisibility. We sought to identify predictors of MRI-invisible (MRI(-)) disease.
METHODS: Men undergoing MRI/US-fusion targeted + systematic biopsy by two surgeons at our institution from 2015 to 2018 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical data, MRI metrics, and biopsy pathology results were obtained by chart review. An MRI(-) tumor was defined as a positive systematic biopsy in a zone without an MRI lesion. Factors associated with presence of MRI(-) tumors were identified using stepwise multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 194 men included in the analysis, 79 (41%) and 25 (13%) men had GG1+ and GG2+ MRI(-) tumors, respectively. On multivariable analysis, only Black race was associated with presence of GG1+ MRI(-) tumors (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02-4.96). Black race (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.24-9.87) and higher PSA density (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.34-3.20) were associated with presence of GG2+ MRI(-) tumors. In non-Black and Black men, detection of MRI(-) tumors on systematic biopsy upgraded patients from no disease to GG2+ disease 1% and 11% of the time, respectively, and from GG1 to GG2+ disease 42% and 60% of the time, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Black race and PSA density were associated with presence of MRI(-) prostate cancer. Further study on racial differences is warranted based on these results. Surgeons should consider pre-biopsy risk factors before deciding to omit systematic prostate biopsy regardless of mpMRI results.},

Objective: To investigate time trends in the use of RP by tumor risk and Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index (PCCI) score in a contemporary, nationally representative Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 5736 men treated with RP at 8 VA hospitals from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2017, used a nationally representative, multicenter sample from the VA SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database. Statistical analysis was performed from June 30, 2018, to August 20, 2020.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Stratified linear and log-linear Poisson regressions were used to estimate time trends in the proportion of men treated with RP across American Urological Association tumor risk and PCCI (a validated predictor of LE based on age and comorbidities) subgroups.
Results: Among 5736 men (mean [SD] age at surgery, 62 [6] years) treated with RP from 2000 to 2017, the proportion of low-risk tumors treated with RP decreased from 51% to 7% (difference, -44%; 95% CI, -50% to -38%). The proportion of intermediate-risk tumors treated with RP increased from 30% to 59% (difference, 29%; 95% CI, 23%-35%), with unfavorable intermediate-risk tumors increasing from 30% to 41% (difference, 11%; 95% CI, 4%-18%) and favorable intermediate-risk tumors decreasing from 61% to 41% (difference, -20%; 95% CI, -24% to -15%). The proportion of high-risk tumors treated with RP increased from 18% to 33% (difference, 15%; 95% CI, 9%-21%). Among men treated with RP, the proportion with the highest PCCI scores of 10 or more (ie, LE <10 years) increased from 4% to 13% (difference, 9%; 95% CI, 4%-14%). Within each tumor risk subgroup, no significant difference in the rate of tumors treated with RP over time was found across PCCI subgroups.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the use of RP shifted from low-risk and favorable intermediate-risk to higher-risk prostate cancer. However, its use among men with limited LE appears unchanged across tumor risk subgroups and increased overall.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern disease staging systems have restructured human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative (HPV-) and HPV-positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) into distinct pathologic nodal systems. Given that quantitative lymph node (LN) burden is the dominant prognostic factor in most head and neck cancers, we investigated whether HPV- and HPV+ OPC warrant divergent pathologic nodal classification.
METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression models of OPC surgical patients identified via U.S. cancer registry data were constructed to determine associations between survival and nodal characteristics. Nonlinear associations between metastatic LN number and survival were modeled with restricted cubic splines. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to derive unbiased nodal schema.
RESULTS: Mortality risk escalated continuously with each successive positive LN in both OPC subtypes, with analogous slope. Survival hazard increased by 18.5% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.16-1.21]; P < .001) and 19.1% (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.17-1.21]; P < .001), with each added positive LN for HPV- and HPV+ OPC, respectively, up to identical change points of 5 positive LNs. Extranodal extension (ENE) was an independent predictor of HPV- OPC (HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.20-1.99]; P < .001) and HPV+ OPC (HR 1.73 [95% CI, 1.36-2.20]; P < .001) mortality. In RPA for both diseases, metastatic LN was the principal nodal covariate driving survival, with ENE as a secondary determinant. Given the similarities across analyses, we propose a concise, unifying HPV-/HPV+ OPC pathologic nodal classification schema: N1, 1-5 LN+/ENE-; N2, 1-5 LN+/ENE+; N3, >5 LN+.
CONCLUSION: HPV- and HPV+ OPC exhibit parallel relationships between nodal characteristics and relative mortality. In both diseases, metastatic LN number represents the principal nodal covariate governing survival, with ENE being an influential secondary element. A consolidated OPC pathologic nodal staging system that is based on these covariates may best convey prognosis.
LAY SUMMARY: The current nodal staging system for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) has divided human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative (HPV-) and HPV-positive (HPV+) OPC into distinct systems that rely upon criteria that establish them as separate entities, a complexity that may undermine the core objective of staging schema to clearly communicate prognosis. Our large-scale analysis revealed that HPV- and HPV+ pathologic nodal staging systems in fact mirror each other. Multiple analyses produced conspicuously similar nodal staging systems, with metastatic lymph node number and extranodal extension delineating the highest risk groups that shape prognosis. We propose unifying HPV- and HPV+ nodal systems to best streamline prognostication and maximize staging accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although higher thyroidectomy volume has been linked with lower complication rates, its association with incidental parathyroidectomy remains less studied. The volume relationship is even less clear for central neck dissection, where individual parathyroid glands are at greater risk.
METHODS: Patients undergoing thyroidectomy with or without central neck dissection were evaluated for incidental parathyroidectomy, hypoparathyroidism, and hypocalcemia. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed using binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 1,114 thyroidectomies and 396 concurrent central neck dissections were performed across 7 surgeons. Incidental parathyroidectomy occurred in 22.4% of surgeries (range, 16.9%-43.6%), affecting 7.1% of parathyroids at risk (range, 5.8%-14.5%). When stratified by surgeon, lower incidental parathyroidectomy rates were associated with higher thyroidectomy volumes (R2 = 0.77, P = .008) and higher central neck dissection volumes (R2 = 0.93, P < .001). On multivariable analysis, low-volume surgeon (odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.06-4.19, P < .001), extrathyroidal extension (odds ratio 3.13, 95% confidence interval 1.24-7.87, P = .016), prophylactic central neck dissection (odds ratio 2.68, 95% confidence interval 1.65-4.35, P <.001), and therapeutic central neck dissection (odds ratio 4.44, 95% confidence interval 1.98-9.96, P < .001) were the most significant factors associated with incidental parathyroidectomy. In addition, incidental parathyroidectomy was associated with a higher likelihood of temporary hypoparathyroidism (odds ratio 2.79, 95% confidence interval 1.45-5.38, P = .002) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (odds ratio 4.62, 95% confidence interval 1.41-5.96, P = .025), but not permanent hypocalcemia (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.48-3.35, P = .63). Higher lymph node yield in central neck dissection was not associated with higher incidental parathyroidectomy rates (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.85-8.81, P = .82).
CONCLUSION: Higher surgical volume conferred a lower rate of incidental parathyroidectomy. Nonetheless, greater lymph node yield in central neck dissections did not result in greater parathyroid-related morbidity. Such findings support the value of leveraging surgical volume to both optimize oncologic resection and minimize complication rates.},

Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a promising alternative treatment given superior quality of life. The aims of this study were to 1) characterize trends and correlates for TARE as first-line treatment of HCC patients with MVI in the US and 2) compare survival after TARE versus systemic therapy. Methods: We used the US National Cancer Database to identify patients with T3BN0M0 HCC during 2010-2017. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with use of TARE vs. systemic therapy and Cox proportional hazards regression to identify factors associated with overall survival. Results: Of 11,259 patients with T3BN0M0 HCC, 1454 (12.9%) and 3915 (34.7%) patients were treated with TARE and systemic therapy, respectively. The proportion of patients who received TARE increased from 13.0% in 2010 to 37.0% in 2017. Older age, White race, and receiving care at an academic cancer program were associated with receipt of TARE, while lack of insurance, higher MELD score, Charlson comorbidity Index ≥3, and Northeast region were associated with receipt of systemic therapy. TARE was associated with reduced mortality compared to systemic therapy (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.68-0.80), with consistent results observed in propensity weighted analysis and across all examined subgroups. Conclusion: Use of TARE as first-line therapy for HCC with MVI has increased in the US. Patient characteristics, region, and medical center type affected the use of TARE. TARE was associated with reduced mortality compared to systemic therapy for HCC patients with MVI.},

When performed, incidental radiologic findings of uncertain significance are often encountered. The purpose of this study was to compare incidental findings seen on staging imaging with distant recurrence in patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). 396 patients with BC who had NAC from 2008 to 2016 were identified from a prospectively maintained data base. Staging imaging was reviewed. Of 396 patients with BC treated with NAC, patients with a positive PET/CT for metastatic disease (n = 36, 9.1%), those that did not undergo staging imaging (n = 49, 12.4%), or those that did not have a reported incidental finding (n = 49, 12.4%) were excluded from analysis. Of the 262 patients who met criteria, mean age was 50 years (range: 26-88). 201 (76.7%) patients had stage I-II cancer, and 61 (23.3%) patients had stage III cancer. Overall, 146 (55.7%) patients had an incidental finding on imaging. 90 (34.4%) patients had one finding, 42 (16.0%) patients had two, and 14 (5.3%) patients had three or more findings. The majority of incidental findings were seen in the ovary/uterus (29.7%), followed by lung (18.4%), liver (10.3%), and bone (9.0%). 5 (3.4%) patients had additional imaging performed. At mean follow-up of 3.7 years (range: 0.7-10.8), 43 (15.6%) patients had a distant recurrence. Of these patients, only 5 (1.9%) patients had distant metastasis in the same organ that was initially thought to be an incidental finding. Our results suggest that breast cancer patients with incidental findings on preoperative staging imaging are unlikely to be indicative of sites for future metastasis.},

METHODS: HNSCC patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 and undergoing primary surgery in the National Cancer Data Base were identified. Propensity score matching and multivariable Cox regression were performed.
RESULTS: Among 27 041 HNSCC patients, 13 941 had oral cavity cancers (OCC). Intermediate-grade (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.26, P < .001) and high-grade (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26-1.52, P < .001) tumors had worse survival than low-grade tumors. This magnitude was comparable to other well-established prognostic factors, including margin positivity, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion. By contrast, there was no association between grade and survival in larynx/hypopharynx or HPV(-) oropharynx cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic impact of pathologic grade is highly variable across head and neck subsites and is the strongest among OCC patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While numerous factors affect prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the comparative impact of histologic grade has not been well described. Moreover, indications for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) remain imprecise. We evaluate clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for PTC stratified by grade.
METHODS: We profiled histologic grade for PTC (well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated) via hospital (National Cancer Database) and population-based (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) registries. Cox regression was used to adjust for clinicopathologic covariates. Statistical interactions between subtypes and the effect of EBRT on survival were assessed.
RESULTS: Collectively, worsening clinicopathologic factors (age, tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, nodal spread, M1 disease) and outcomes (disease-free survival, overall survival) correlated with less differentiated state, across all histologic grades (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed escalating hazard with loss of differentiation relative to well-differentiated PTC (moderately differentiated hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.41, p = 0.02; poorly differentiated HR 2.62, 95% CI 2.23-3.08, p < 0.001). Correspondingly, greater survival benefit was associated with EBRT for poorly differentiated cases (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18-0.72, p = 0.004). This finding was upheld after landmark analysis to address potential immortal time bias (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17-0.80, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Worsening histologic grade in PTC is independently associated with parallel escalation in mortality risk, on a scale approximating or surpassing established thyroid cancer risk factors. On preliminary analysis, EBRT was associated with improved survival in the most aggressive or least differentiated subvariants. Further investigation is warranted to examine the efficacy of EBRT for select poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and often occurs due to misattribution of non-MS magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions to MS demyelination. A recently developed MRI biomarker, the central vein sign (CVS), has demonstrated high specificity for MS lesions and may thus help prevent misdiagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the potential "real world" diagnostic value of CVS by comparing CVS in patients with MS and patients previously misdiagnosed with MS.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with MS and 15 misdiagnosed with MS were prospectively recruited to undergo 3T brain MRI. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2*-weighted segmented echo-planar-imaging (T2*-EPI) were acquired. The generated FLAIR* images were analyzed by two independent raters. The percentage of lesions with CVS was calculated for each patient.
RESULTS: A CVS lesion threshold of 29% or higher resulted in high sensitivity (0.79) and specificity (0.88) for MS and correctly identified 87% of patients previously misdiagnosed with MS. Interrater reliability for CVS was high with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.86.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the ability of CVS to differentiate between patients with MS and patients with an MS misdiagnosis resulting from standard MRI and clinical evaluation. Clinical application of CVS may reduce MS misdiagnosis.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether women and men have disparate outcomes in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).
METHODS: Patients with nonmetastatic MCC undergoing surgery and lymph node evaluation were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for overall survival, and competing-risks analysis and Fine-Gray models were used for cause-specific and other-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The NCDB cohort (n = 4178) included 1516 (36%) women. Women had a consistent survival advantage compared with men in propensity score-matched analysis (66.0% vs 56.8% at 5 years, P < .001) and multivariable Cox regression (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.75; P < .001). Similarly, women had a survival advantage in the SEER validation cohort (n = 1202) with 457 (38.0%) women, which was entirely due to differences in MCC-specific mortality (5-year cumulative incidence: 16.4% vs 26.7%, P = .002), with no difference in other-cause mortality (16.8% vs 17.8%, P = .43) observed in propensity score-matched patients.
LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias from a retrospective data set.

Mortality risk increased continuously with each additional positive LN when using multivariable, nonlinear modeling. According to a novel staging system derived via recursive partitioning analysis, the hazard ratio for death in multivariable regression compared with patients without LN involvement was 1.24 (P = .049), 2.08 (P < .001), 3.24 (P < .001), and 6.13 (P < .001) for the proposed N1a (1-3 metastatic LNs with microscopic detection), N1b (1-3 metastatic LNs with macroscopic detection), N2 (4-8 metastatic LNs), and N3 (≥9 metastatic LNs), respectively. This system was validated in the SEER cohort and showed improved concordance compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition.

This study illustrates alternative approaches to toxicity evaluation using the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project R-04 clinical trial as an example.
METHODS: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project R-04 was a neoadjuvant chemoradiation trial in stage II-III rectal cancer patients. A 2 x 2 factorial design was used to evaluate whether the addition of oxaliplatin (Oxa) to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) or capecitabine (Cape) with radiation therapy improved local-regional tumor control. The toxicity index (TI), which accounts for the frequency and severity of toxicities, was compared across treatments using multivariable probabilistic index models, where Pr A < B indicates the probability that higher values of TI were observed for A when compared with B. Baseline age, sex, performance status, body mass index, surgery type, and stage were evaluated as independent risk factors.
RESULTS: A total of 4560 toxicities from 1558 patients were analyzed. Results from adjusted probabilistic index models indicate that oxaliplatin-containing regimens had statistically significant (P < .001) probability (Pr) for higher TI compared with regimens without oxaliplatin (Pr 5FU < 5FU + Oxa = 0.619, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.560 to 0.674; Pr 5FU < Cape + Oxa = 0.627, 95% CI = 0.568 to 0.682; Pr Cape < 5FU + Oxa = 0.587, 95% 0.527 to 0.644; and Pr Cape < Cape + Oxa = 0.596, 95% 0.536 to 0.653). When compared with other existing toxicity analysis methods, TI provided greater power to detect differences between treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: This article uses standard data collected in a cancer clinical trial to introduce descriptive and analytic methods that account for the additional burden of multiple toxicities. These methods may provide a more accurate description of a patient's treatment experience that could lead to individualized dosing for better toxicity control. Future research will evaluate the generalizability of these findings in trials with similar drugs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) without chemotherapy is considered a standard of care for the management of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition (7E) T1-2N1 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Recent data suggests concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) may benefit these patients but did not include human papillomavirus (HPV) status. Given the radiosensitivity differences between HPV-positive versus HPV-negative OPSCC, the effect of chemotherapy may differ in these patients.
METHODS: We analyzed patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 with AJCC 7E stage cT1-2N1M0 OPSCC and known HPV status undergoing definitive RT or CCRT.
RESULTS: Overall, 1964 patients were included, including 1297 (66%) HPV-positive and 667 (34%) HPV-negative patients. 66% received CCRT and 34% received RT alone. In multivariate analysis, CCRT was associated with improved survival compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.87; P = 0.001). In propensity score-matched cohorts, 4-year overall survival was 87.4% vs 78.4% in HPV-positive patients receiving CCRT and RT alone, respectively (P = 0.002), and 65.5% vs 58.9% in HPV-negative patients, respectively (P = 0.2). There was no evidence that HPV-positivity diminished the association between CCRT and longer survival (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.81) versus what was observed in HPV-negative patients (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.64-1.16) (interaction P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: CCRT is associated with improved survival in AJCC 7E T1-2N1 OPSCC. Despite the radiosensitivity of HPV-positive OPSCC, the association of CCRT with improved survival for T1-2N1 HPV-positive OPSCC was at least as strong, if not stronger, than what was observed in HPV-negative patients.},

However, it is unclear if consumers can differentiate between the various rated subdimensions of physicians. It is also unclear how each subdimension is related to overall satisfaction.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to determine the correlation of physician-based and office-based subdimensions of care and the association of each with overall satisfaction.
METHODS: We sampled 212,933 providers from the Healthgrades website and calculated average provider metrics for overall satisfaction (likelihood to recommend doctor), physician-based subdimensions (trust in physician, ability to explain, ability to listen and answer questions, and spending adequate time), and office-based subdimensions (ease of scheduling, office environment, staff friendliness, and wait time). We used Spearman rank correlation to assess correlation between subdimension ratings. Factor analysis was used to identify potential latent factors predicting overall satisfaction. Univariate and multivariable linear regression were performed to assess the effect of physician and office-based factors on overall satisfaction.
RESULTS: Physician-based metrics were highly correlated with each other (r=.95 to .98, P<.001), as were office-based metrics (r=.84 to .88, P<.001). Correlations between physician-based and office-based ratings were less robust (r=.79 to .81, P<.001). Factor analysis identified two factors, clearly distinguishing between physician-based metrics (factor loading = 0.84 to 0.88) and office-based metrics (factor loading = 0.76 to 0.84). In multivariable linear regression analysis, the composite factor representing physician-based metrics (0.65, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.65) was more strongly associated with overall satisfaction than the factor representing office-based metrics (0.42, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.42). These factors eclipsed other demographic variables in predicting overall satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumers do not differentiate between commonly assessed subdimensions of physician-based care or subdimensions of office-based care, but composite factors representing these broader categories are associated with overall satisfaction. These findings argue for a simpler ratings system based on two metrics: one addressing physician-based aspects of care and another addressing office-based aspects of care.},

RTS at diagnosis, RTS post-NAT, and VTL were determined. Clinical and treatment characteristics, IBTR, and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between pre-NAT (n = 51) and post-NAT (n = 33) groups. Compared to post-NAT patients, pre-NAT patients had smaller RTS at presentation (9.2 vs. 33.5 cm3, P < .001) and post-NAT (1.2 vs. 8.2 cm3, P = .024). At median follow-up of 4 years, there were no differences between groups in pathologic tumor size, positive margin rate, adjuvant therapy, IBTR, or DFS. Resection volumes that matched RTS on post-NAT imaging were not associated with increased positive margins or IBTR. It may be appropriate to use post-NAT imaging to guide lumpectomy volume.},

Objective: To compare the long-term outcomes of transoral robotic surgery with those of nonrobotic surgery for patients with early-stage oropharyngeal cancer.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort comparative effectiveness analysis was performed of patients in the National Cancer Database with clinical T1 and T2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, who underwent definitive robotic and nonrobotic surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching were performed in patients with known human papillomavirus status to adjust for patient- and disease-related covariates. Survival after robotic and nonrobotic surgery was also compared in 3 unrelated cancers: prostate, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Statistical analysis was performed from April 10, 2019, to May 21, 2020.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival.
Results: Of 9745 patients (7652 men [78.5%]; mean [SD] age, 58.8 [9.6] years) who met inclusion criteria, 2694 (27.6%) underwent transoral robotic surgery. There was a significant increase in the use of robotic surgery from 18.3% (240 of 1309) to 35.5% (654 of 1841) of all surgical procedures for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal cancers from 2010 to 2015 (P = .003). Robotic surgery was associated with lower rates of positive surgical margins (12.5% [218 of 1746] vs 20.3% [471 of 2325]; P < .001) and lower use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (28.6% [500 of 1746] vs 35.7% [831 of 2325]; P < .001). Among 4071 patients with known human papillomavirus status, robotic surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95 CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .002). Similar results were seen when analyzing only the subset of facilities offering both robotic and nonrobotic surgery. The 5-year overall survival was 84.8% vs 80.3% among patients undergoing robotic vs nonrobotic surgery in propensity score-matched cohorts (P = .001). By contrast, there was no evidence that robotic surgery was associated with improved survival in other cancers, such as prostate cancer (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.07; P = .26), endometrial cancer (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.04; P = .36), and cervical cancer (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96-1.69; P = .10).
Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that transoral robotic surgery was associated with improved surgical outcomes and survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in patients with early-stage oropharyngeal cancer. Evaluation in comparative randomized trials is warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It remains unknown to what extent hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are detected very early (T1 stage; ie, unifocal <2 cm) in the United States. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends and factors associated with very early detection of HCC and resultant outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with HCC diagnosed from 2004 through 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with T1 HCC detection, and Cox proportional hazard analyses identified factors associated with overall survival among patients with T1 HCC.
RESULTS: Of 110,182 eligible patients, the proportion with T1 HCC increased from 2.6% in 2004 to 6.8% in 2014 (P<.01). The strongest correlate of T1 HCC detection was receipt of care at an academic institution (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% CI, 2.31-5.34). Older age, lack of insurance, high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, high alpha-fetoprotein, increased Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, and nonsurgical treatment were associated with increased mortality, and care at an academic center (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15-0.48) was associated with reduced mortality in patients with T1 HCC. Liver transplantation (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.37) and surgical resection (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.93) were independently associated with improved survival compared with ablation. This is the first study to examine the trend of T1 HCC using the National Cancer Database, which covers approximately 70% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States, using robust statistical analyses. Limitations of the study include a retrospective study design using administrative data and some pertinent data that were not available.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite increases over time, <10% of HCCs are detected at T1 stage. The strongest correlates of survival among patients with T1 HCC are receiving care at an academic institution and surgical treatment.},

METHODS: A total of 5304 patients from the National Cancer Database with stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma undergoing surgery were analyzed. High-volume facilities were the top 1% by case volume. Multivariable Cox regression and propensity score-matching were performed to account for imbalances between groups.
RESULTS: Treatment at high-volume facilities (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.84, P < .001) was independently associated with improved overall survival (OS) in multivariable analyses. In propensity score-matched cohorts, 5-year OS was 62.3% at high-volume facilities vs 56.8% at lower-volume facilities (P < .001). Median OS was 111 months at high-volume facilities vs 79 months at lower-volume facilities.
CONCLUSION: Treatment at high-volume facilities is associated with improved OS in Merkel cell carcinoma. Given the impracticality of referring all elderly patients with Merkel cell carcinoma to a small number of facilities, methods to mitigate this disparity should be explored.},

  abstract = {Importance: While well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (WDPTC) outcomes have been well characterized, the prognostic implications of more aggressive variants are far less defined. The rarity of these subtypes has led to their consolidation as intermediate risk for what are in fact likely heterogeneous diseases.
Objective: To analyze incidence, clinicopathologic characteristics, and outcomes for aggressive variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from 2000 to 2016 from hospital-based and population-based US cancer registries to analyze aggressive PTC variants, including diffuse sclerosing (DSV), tall-cell (TCV), insular, and poorly differentiated (PDTC) subtypes. These variants were compared against WDPTC and anaplastic cases. Data analysis was conducted from January 2019 to October 2019.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-adjusted incidence was calculated via annual percentage change (APC) using the weighted least-squares method. Overall survival and disease-specific survival were analyzed via Cox regression. Propensity-score matching was used to adjust survival analyses for clinical and demographic covariates.
Results: Collectively, 5447 aggressive PTC variants were identified (including 415 DSV, 3339 TCV, 362 insular, and 1331 PDTC cases), as well as 35 812 WDPTC and 2249 anaplastic cases. Over the study period, a substantial increase in aggressive variant incidence was observed (APC, 9.1 [95% CI, 7.33-10.89]; P < .001), surpassing the relative increases observed in WDPTC (APC, 5.1 [95% CI, 3.98-6.12]; P < .001) and anaplastic cases (APC, 1.9 [95% CI, 0.75-3.05]; P = .003; parallelism P < .007). Survival varied markedly based on histologic subtype, with a wide spectrum of mortality risk noted; 10-year overall survival was 85.4% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.3%) in WDPTC, 79.2% (95% CI, 73.6%-85.3%) in DSV, 71.9% (95% CI, 68.4%-75.6%) in TCV, 45.1% (95% CI, 40.2%-50.6%) in PDTC, 27.9% (95% CI, 20.0%-38.9%) in the insular variant, and 8.9% (95% CI, 7.5%-10.6%) in anaplastic cases (P < .001). These differences largely persisted even after adjusting for inherent differences in baseline characteristics by multivariable Cox regression and propensity-score matching.
Conclusions and Relevance: An upsurge in aggressive PTC incidence was observed at a rate beyond that seen in WDPTC or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, long-term survival outcomes for aggressive PTC subgroups exhibit heterogeneous clinical behavior and a wide range of mortality risk, suggesting that treatment should be tailored to specific histologic subtypes. Given increasing prevalence and disparate outcomes, further investigation to identify optimal therapeutic strategies is needed in these diverse, understudied populations.},

The immune system is known to play a key role in controlling the growth and spread of malignancies, but whether age- and sex-dependent changes in immune cell function account for this effect remains unknown. Here, we show that in castrated male mice, neutrophil maturation and function are impaired, leading to elevated metastatic burden in two models of melanoma. Replacement of testosterone effectively normalized the tumor burden in castrated male mice. Further, the aberrant neutrophil phenotype was also observed in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy, highlighting the evolutionary conservation and clinical relevance of the phenotype. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the role of androgen signaling in neutrophil function and the impact of this biology on immune control of malignancies.},

We sought to characterise the impact of primary payer on overall survival (OS) in insured patients younger than 65 with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with definitive radiotherapy.
DESIGN/STUDY/PARTICIPANTS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients <65 years old diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 undergoing definitive radiotherapy ± chemotherapy for cancers of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. Uninsured patients and oropharyngeal cancers without known HPV status were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOME: Overall survival.
RESULTS: Overall, 27 292 insured patients were identified, including 17 060 (62.5%) with private insurance. Median follow-up was 52.1 months. In multivariable models, patients receiving Medicaid (HR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.57-1.75, P < .001), Medicare (HR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.55-1.73, P < .001) and other government insurance (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29-1., P < .001) had independently increased mortality in comparison to those with private insurance. In propensity score-matched cohorts, 5-year OS was 65.5% vs 50.6% for privately vs government-insured patients, respectively (P < .001). In multivariable subgroup analysis, private insurance was associated with improved survival in all subgroups. However, the magnitude of this effect was most pronounced in patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer vs non-HPV-related cancer (interaction P < .001), younger patients (interaction P = .001), and those without comorbidity (interaction P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients <65 with HNSCC undergoing definitive radiation with private health insurance have markedly longer survival relative to patients with government-sponsored insurance. This illustrates that increasing access to care may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to mitigate the significant disparities in the US healthcare system.},

These patients historically were treated with disparate treatment regimens, particularly with respect to the use of concurrent chemotherapy.
METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with AJCC eighth edition clinical stage I HPV-positive OPSCC (AJCC seventh edition stage T1-2N0-2bM0) who were diagnosed from 2010 to 2014 and underwent definitive radiotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy with definitive radiotherapy was defined as chemotherapy administered within 7 days of the initiation of radiotherapy.
RESULTS: The current analysis included 4473 patients with HPV-positive stage I OPSCC with a median follow-up of 36.3 months. A total of 3127 patients (69.9%) received concurrent chemotherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy was found to be associated with improved overall survival on multivariable analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 0.782; 95% CI, 0.645-0.948 [P = .012]). The effect of chemotherapy on survival varied based on lymph node involvement (P for interaction = .001). Specifically, chemotherapy was associated with improved survival for patients with lymph node-positive stage I disease (stage III-IVA according to the AJCC seventh edition: HR, 0.682; 95% CI, 0.557-0.835 [P < .001]), but not for patients with N0 disease (stage I-II according to the AJCC seventh edition: HR, 1.646; 95% CI, 1.011-2.681 [P = .05]). Similar results were noted among propensity score-matched cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with concurrent chemotherapy was associated with improved overall survival for patients with lymph node-positive, but not lymph node-negative, AJCC eighth edition stage I HPV-positive OPSCC undergoing definitive radiotherapy, thereby supporting different treatment paradigms for these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has dramatically increased in incidence and prevalence among patients aged 70 and older. There are virtually no data regarding outcomes in this population, and thus optimal therapy, including the role of chemotherapy for those undergoing radiotherapy (RT), remains unclear.
METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for older adults (defined as age 70 years and older) with locally advanced OPSCC (cT1-2N1-3, cT3-4N0-3) diagnosed from 2010 to 2014 with known HPV-status undergoing definitive RT alone or chemoradiation (CRT).
RESULTS: Overall, 1,965 older adults with locally advanced OPSCC met inclusion criteria, including 1,141 HPV-positive (58%) and 824 HPV-negative (42%) patients. 1,211 patients (62%) received CRT. In multivariable analysis, CRT was associated with improved survival in older patients when compared to RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.86, P < 0.001). CRT was associated with improved survival in both HPV-positive (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64-1.00, P = 0.05) and HPV-negative (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.85, P < 0.001) subgroups. There was no significant interaction between HPV status and the impact of CRT on survival (P interaction = 0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the radiosensitivity of HPV-positive OPSCC and the challenges in delivering CRT to older adults, CRT was associated with improved survival in older patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, similar in magnitude to the benefit in HPV-negative patients. As the incidence of HPV-positive OPSCC in older patients continues to increase, further studies are needed to investigate optimal therapeutic strategies in this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current pathological nodal staging for bladder cancer is based on lymph node (LN) location but not on the number of positive LNs.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to improve prognostic classification by creating a novel staging system incorporating positive LN burden.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We sampled 12515 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and 5928 MIBC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for our development and validation cohorts, respectively.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with restricted cubic splines was used to assess the association between the number of metastatic LNs and overall mortality (OM). A novel staging system was derived by recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) in NCDB and was validated in SEER by assessing discrimination (Harrel's c-index) and calibration (mean absolute prediction error).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Mortality risk increased continuously with more metastatic LNs; the effect was most pronounced up to four LNs (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.22) and attenuated beyond four nodes (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05). RPA generated a novel staging system predicting mortality by metastatic nodal number with cutpoints at zero (reference), one (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.46-1.69), two to three (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.88-2.19), four to seven (HR 2.46, 95% CI 2.25-2.70), and more than seven (HR 3.83, 95% CI 3.38-4.33) positive LNs. Location of LN involvement was not a significant predictor of OM. In external validation, the novel staging system showed good risk discrimination (optimism corrected c-index 0.677, 95% CI 0.672-0.682) and calibration (mean absolute prediction error 0.011 for 5-yr OM). Results are limited by development and validation using secondary data.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic LNs predicts mortality better than LN location and may improve pathological nodal staging in MIBC.
PATIENT SUMMARY: This retrospective study found that the number of metastatic lymph nodes more accurately predicts survival than the location of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This finding argues for change to the current bladder cancer staging system.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent evaluation of female representation in major radiation oncology organizations was published by Knoll et al. (IJROBP, 2018) but did not include information about the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS). The objective of this study is to assess trends in gender diversity in the ABS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly available information from the ABS and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) websites were used to determine the proportion of women in various leadership positions and receiving awards and honors. The data were organized by comparing female representation up until 2004 and then from 2005 until current as was done in the article of Knoll et al. to facilitate comparisons with ASTRO.
RESULTS: Of the 579 US physician members of the ABS, 155 (27%) are women. There has been an increase in the proportion of female ABS presidents and female Hensche Award recipients between 1978-2004 and 2005-2018. There was a significant difference in the female makeup of the editorial board of the main journals for the ABS (18%) and ASTRO (43%) (p = 0.02). Two other prominent differences between the ABS and ASTRO, however not statistically significant, were the female representation of 2018 fellows (10% vs. 26%, respectively) and recipients of each organization's highest honor between 2005 and 2017 (25% vs. 6%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past decade, there has been an increase in women representation in the ABS presidency and Henschke awardees. Representation still remains low, relative to ASTRO, in other areas suggesting room for further improvement. Exploring these trends is imperative in developing potential solutions to improve gender diversity in the field of brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {Background: Active surveillance is established as an alternative to surgery for papillary thyroid microcarcinomas, but inclusion criteria and mortality risk for pursuing a nonsurgical approach have not been clearly defined. To gauge the feasibility of expanding active surveillance thresholds, we investigated the effects of increasing size and age on disease-specific survival (DSS) in a large nonoperative thyroid cancer cohort, compared against a matched group of surgical patients. Methods: Papillary thyroid carcinoma patients staged T1-4N0M0 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1975 and 2015, stratified by nonsurgical and surgical management. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for imbalances in covariates. Multivariable models were constructed using restricted cubic splines to model nonlinear relationships of age and tumor size with DSS. Results: Overall, 1453 nonoperative patients and 54,718 surgical patients met the inclusion criteria. Collectively, increasing age and size after certain thresholds independently led to greater differences in DSS between nonsurgical and surgical patients. For younger ages (14-55 years), surgical approach compared with nonsurgical approach was not associated with any difference in the 10-year DSS among 0-4 cm cancers (99.8% vs. 100%, p = 0.470), 4.1-6 cm cancers (98.8% vs. 100%, p = 0.599), or >6 cm cancers (97.3% vs. 100%, p = 0.718). Older patients with larger tumors (>75 years, >6 cm) demonstrated the greatest difference in DSS (48.1% vs. 91.3%, p < 0.001). Similar results were found when applying propensity score matching. For age, restricted cubic spline plots showed minimal relative survival hazard in nonoperative cases beginning after age 60 years, with a change point illustrating acceleration in relative hazard beyond age 72 years. For size, relative survival hazard was observed after 2.0 cm and increased slowly with nodule growth up to an inflection point of 4.5 cm. Beyond this, mortality risk escalated with each additional year without plateau. Conclusions: Increasing age and size lead to progressively greater mortality risk without surgery, but only beyond certain thresholds. We define escalating gradients at which a nonsurgical approach may be deemed appropriate, and beyond which survival benefits from surgery become apparent. Such findings reconcile controversial observations regarding age and size in active surveillance and further reshape evolving treatment paradigms in thyroid cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) discourage the use of imaging to stage newly diagnosed early breast cancer (stages 1 and 2). This study aimed to evaluate preoperative staging imaging rates among patients with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
METHODS: From a prospectively maintained database, 303 patients with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer who had NAC from 2008 to 2016 were identified. The main outcome measures were the rate and outcomes of staging imaging performed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 303 patients with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer was 51 years (range, 26-87 years). Of these 303 patients, 278 (92.4%) had invasive ductal cancer. 90 (30.2%) had estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease, 79 (26.5%) had triple-negative disease, and 127 (42.6%) had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease. Staging positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for 258 patients (85.2%), brain imaging for 94 patients (31%), bone scans for 117 patients (38.6%), and all three for 48 patients (15.8%). As a result, 15 patients (4.9%) with a positive PET/CT scan were upstaged to stage 4 breast cancer. No difference was observed among the ER-positive (p = 1.000), HER2-positive (p = 0.259), or triple-negative (p = 0.369) receptor profiles of the patients upstaged to stage 4 disease. One patient (1.1%) had positive brain imaging. Five patients (4.3%) had a positive bone scan, and three of these patients (60%) had bone metastasis also shown on the PET/CT scan.
CONCLUSION: Despite guideline recommendations, a high rate of preoperative staging imaging is completed for patients with clinical stage 1 or 2 breast cancer who receive NAC, with few positive results.},

This study evaluated trends in axillary operations before and after publication of these trials.
METHODS: This study analyzed patients from National Cancer Database (NCDB) with clinical T0 through T4, N1 and N2, M0 breast cancer who received NAC from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015 and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The patients were divided into the following groups: SNB, ALND, and (SNB + ALND).
RESULTS: Of the 32,036 evaluable patients identified in this study. 5565 had SNB, 19,930 had ALND, and 6541 had SNB + ALND. Compared with the ALND group, the SNB group was younger, had more invasive ductal cancers, and had lower clinical T- and N-stage disease (p < 0.001). The patients in the SNB group had a higher rate of estrogen receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, but a lower rate of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer (p < 0.001). The nodal pathologic complete response (PCR) rate, defined as no residual invasive cancer, was 66.5% in the SNB group and 33.1% in the ALND group. Since 2013, the rate of ALND has decreased from 88.7 to 77.1% in both community and academic institutions (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Since publication of the ACOSOG Z1071 and SENTINA trials, the national rates of ALND in node positive breast cancer treated with NAC have decreased despite reported false-negative SNB rates and lack of prospective outcome data regarding the oncologic safety of ALND omission.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of life expectancy is critical to treatment decision making in men with prostate cancer. We sought to externally validate the PCCI (Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index) to predict long-term mortality in men with prostate cancer and make it operational using claims data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational study of 181,009 men with prostate cancer in the Veterans Affairs Health System who were diagnosed from 2000 to 2013. Overall mortality across the PCCI scores was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Discrimination and calibration were measured using the C-index and the mean prediction error, respectively.
RESULTS: Among men with a PCCI score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9 and 10 or greater the 10-year overall mortality rate was 15%, 26%, 36%, 41%, 52% and 69%, respectively. Multivariable Cox analysis showed an increasing hazard of mortality with higher PCCI scores, including 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27), 1.69 (95% CI 1.61-1.76), 2.08 (95% CI 2.00-2.17), 2.88 (95% CI 2.76-3.00) and 4.50 (95% CI 4.32-4.69) for a score of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9 and 10 or greater, respectively. The C-index to predict overall mortality was 0.773. The mean absolute error to predict 10-year overall mortality was 0.032. Of the men with clinically localized disease, Gleason 6 or less with less than 10-year life expectancy and Gleason 7 or less with life expectancy less than 5 years as defined by the PCCI 3,999 of 12,185 (33%) and 1,038 of 3,930 (26%), respectively, underwent definitive local treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The PCCI is a claims based, externally validated tool to predict mortality in men with prostate cancer. Integrating the PCCI into clinical pathways may improve prostate cancer management through more accurate assessment of life expectancy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Bone metastases are reported in 10% to 12% of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and can lead to pain and skeletal-related events (SREs), resulting in diminished quality of life and functional status. In other solid tumors with bone metastases, radiation therapy (RT) is an established treatment approach for SREs, yet few data are available in NENs historically considered to be radioresistant. We hypothesize that RT is effective for pain and other SREs in NENs and aimed to delineate any differences in pain palliation and time until progression of pain between different fractionation and dosing schedules of RT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 686 records of patients with NENs treated at the institution between 2011 and 2018 and identified 28 (4.1%) patients treated with RT for 61 cases of SREs. The primary endpoint was change in patient reported pain scores after RT.
RESULTS: All 28 patients experienced bone pain. Nineteen sites were treated with a single fraction (doses of 800-1800 cGy) and 42 sites with fractionated regimens (doses of 900-3750 cGy over 3-15 fractions). In 55 of 61 cases (90%), patients experienced improvement in pain after RT. The median time to recurrence or progression of pain was 3.5 months. Significant differences were found between primary site and change in performance status (P = .024), sex, and reported magnitude of pain score decrease after RT (P = .025). There were no differences in the time to the progression of pain, change in performance status, and degree of improvement in pain based on age, chemotherapy received during RT, or radiation site. Outcomes were similar for patients who received single-fraction versus fractionated regimens (P = .545) and between those receiving palliative versus ablative RT regimens (P = .812).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of cases in this NEN cohort benefited from RT, additional studies on the use of RT in the treatment of painful bone metastases are warranted.},

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective population-based cohort study.
SETTING: National Cancer Database.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with SGC who were undergoing surgery were identified from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2013. Neck dissection removing a minimum of 10 lymph nodes was required. Because PORT violated the proportional hazards assumption, this variable was treated as a time-dependent covariate.
RESULTS: Overall, 4145 cases met inclusion criteria (median follow-up, 54 months). PORT was associated with improved overall survival in multivariable analysis, both ≤9 months from diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20-0.34; P < .001) and >9 months (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P < .001). In propensity score-matched cohorts, 5-year overall survival was 67.1% and 60.6% with PORT and observation, respectively ( P < .001). Similar results were observed in landmark analysis of patients surviving at least 6 months following diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99-1.34; P = .06).
CONCLUSION: PORT, but not chemotherapy, is associated with improved survival among patients with SGC for whom neck dissection was deemed necessary. These results are not applicable to low-risk SGCs not requiring neck dissection.},

Misdiagnosis has significant implications for patient morbidity and healthcare costs, yet its contemporary incidence is unknown. We examined the incidence of MS misdiagnosis in new patients referred to two academic MS referral centers, their most common alternate diagnoses, and factors associated with misdiagnosis.
METHODS: Demographic data, comorbidities, neurological examination findings, radiographic and laboratory results, a determination of 2010 McDonald Criteria fulfillment, and final diagnoses were collected from all new patient evaluations completed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the University of California, Los Angeles MS clinics over twelve months.
RESULTS: Of the 241 new patients referred with an established diagnosis of MS, 17% at Cedars-Sinai and 19% at UCLA were identified as having been misdiagnosed. The most common alternative diagnoses were migraine (16%), radiologically isolated syndrome (9%), spondylopathy (7%), and neuropathy (7%). Clinical syndromes and radiographic findings atypical for MS were both associated with misdiagnosis. The misdiagnosed group received approximately 110 patient-years of unnecessary MS disease modifying therapy.
CONCLUSION: MS misdiagnosis is common; in our combined cohort, almost 1 in 5 patients who carried an established diagnosis of MS did not fulfill contemporary McDonald Criteria and had a more likely alternate diagnosis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: As brachytherapy utilization rates decline, we sought to evaluate the state of brachytherapy training during radiation oncology residency.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: US radiation oncology residents in the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology database were sent an online questionnaire regarding brachytherapy training. Survey questions addressed a wide array of topics, and responses were often given on a 1 to 5 Likert-type scale that reflected strength of opinion. Postgraduate year (PGY) 4/5 respondents' answers were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were generated, and rank correlation analyses (Kendall's τ coefficient and Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for comparisons.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 145 of 567 residents (62% being PGY4/5). Of PGY4/5 respondents, 96% (86 of 90) believed learning brachytherapy during residency was important, and 72% (65 of 90) felt their program valued brachytherapy training. Resident brachytherapy comfort varied by site, decreasing as follows: gynecologic, prostate, breast, skin. The current intracavitary 15-case minimum was believed adequate by most, but only a minority believed the 5-case interstitial minimum was adequate. Most respondents (59%) believed that caseload was the greatest barrier to achieving independence in brachytherapy. Significant support exists for American Brachytherapy Society training courses and on-the-job education to enhance training, but enthusiasm about pursuing brachytherapy fellowship training was low. Most respondents expressed confidence in developing a brachytherapy practice (54%); however, this was significantly lower than the rate of those confident in developing a stereotactic body radiation therapy/stereotactic radiosurgery program (97%) (P < .001). Furthermore, there was an association between aggregate number of brachytherapy cases performed and resident confidence in starting a brachytherapy practice (τ = 0.37; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy is an important component of residency training that is valued by residents and programs. Because caseload was the greatest perceived barrier in brachytherapy training, with confidence correlated with case volume, attempts should be made to expand opportunities for training experiences that are feasible to complete during residency.},

  abstract = {Importance: Early postoperative ambulation is vital to minimizing length of stay (LOS), but few hospitals objectively measure ambulation to predict outcomes. Wearable activity monitors have the potential to transform assessment of postoperative ambulation, but key implementation data, including whether digitally monitored step count can identify patients at risk for poor efficiency outcomes, are lacking.
Objectives: To define the distribution of digitally measured daily step counts after major inpatient surgical procedures, to assess the accuracy of physician assessment and ordering of ambulation, and to quantify the association of digitally measured step count with LOS.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, an urban tertiary referral center. Participants were patients undergoing 8 inpatient operations (lung lobectomy, gastric bypass, hip replacement, robotic cystectomy, open colectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, and laparoscopic colectomy) from July 11, 2016, to August 30, 2017.
Interventions: Use of activity monitors to measure daily postoperative step count.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Operation-specific daily step count, daily step count by physician orders and assessment, and a prolonged LOS (>70th percentile for each operation).
Results: Among 100 patients (53% female), the mean (SD) age was 53 (18) years, and the median LOS was 4 days (interquartile range, 3-6 days). There was a statistically significant increase in daily step count with successive postoperative days in aggregate (r = 0.55; 95% bootstrapped CI, 0.47-0.62; P < .001) and across individual operations. Ninety-five percent (356 of 373) of daily ambulation orders were "ambulate with assistance," although daily step counts ranged from 0 to 7698 steps (0-5.5 km) under this order. Physician estimation of ambulation was predictive of the median step count (r = 0.66; 95% bootstrapped CI, 0.59-0.72; P < .001), although there was substantial variation within each assessment category. For example, daily step counts ranged from 0 to 1803 steps (0-1.3 km) in the "out of bed to chair" category. Higher step count on postoperative day 1 was associated with lower odds of prolonged LOS from 0 to 1000 steps (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84; P = .003), with no further decrease in odds after 1000 steps (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.75-1.30; P = .80).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, digitally measured step count up to 1000 steps on postoperative day 1 was associated with lower probability of a prolonged LOS. Wearable activity monitors improved the accuracy of assessment of daily step count over the current standard of care, providing an opportunity to identify patients at risk for poor efficiency outcomes.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved retrospective review of patients treated at a single institution between 1990 and 2013 was performed. In total, 116 patients were identified who received neoadjuvant ifosfamide-based chemotherapy and 28 Gy in 8 fractions of preoperative radiation (equivalent dose in 2 Gray fractions, 31.5 Gy [α/β 10] 36.4 Gy [α/β 3]) followed by limb-sparing surgery. Local recurrence (LR), distant failure (DF), and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analysis for LR, DF, and OS were performed using Cox analysis. Statistical significance was set at a P<0.05.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.9 years (range, 0.3 to 24 y). Actuarial LR at 3/6 years was 11%/17%, DF at 3/6 years was 25%/35%, and OS at 3/6 years was 82%/67%. On multivariate analysis, only a positive surgical margin was significantly correlated with worse local control (P=0.005; hazard ratio [HR], 18.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.41-139.34). Age over 60 years (P=0.03; HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.10-4.98) and tumor size over 10 cm compared with tumor size ≤5 cm (P=0.03; HR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.15-9.61) were associated with worse OS.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing in incidence among older adults. However, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in driving this trend and its prognostic significance in this population have not been established.
METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with OPSCC diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 undergoing either surgery or radiotherapy (RT) with known HPV status. Older adults were defined as those aged 70 years or older.
RESULTS: Among 43,427 OPSCC patients, the proportion of HPV-positive OPSCC increased from 45.1% to 63.3% in older adults (P < 0.001). In 19,358 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for survival analyses, HPV positivity was associated with improved survival for older adults undergoing either definitive RT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.72, P < 0.001) or surgery (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, P < 0.001) in multivariable analysis. In propensity score-matched cohorts, 3-year overall survival was 69.1% versus 55.5% (P < 0.001) in older adults with HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC undergoing definitive RT, respectively, and 88.5% versus 69.1% (P = 0.001) for older adults undergoing surgery. Although HPV positivity was associated with improved survival among all age groups receiving RT, the magnitude of the effect diminished with increasing age (interaction P < 0.001). No interaction between age and the impact of HPV status on survival was seen for surgical patients (interaction P = 0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiologic landscape of HPV-positive OPSCC is evolving, with a dramatic increase in the proportion of HPV-associated OPSCC among patients 70 years or older. HPV remains a powerful predictor of improved survival in elderly patients, but with less pronounced effect on older adults undergoing definitive RT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because of the potential increased incidence of acute urinary retention, optimal timing of urinary catheter removal after major pelvic colorectal surgery remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the incidence of urinary retention following early catheter removal on postoperative day 1 vs standard catheter removal on day 3.
DESIGN: This is a randomized, noninferiority trial.
SETTING: This study was conducted at an urban teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Patients undergoing colorectal surgery below the peritoneal reflection were selected.
INTERVENTIONS: A 1:1 randomization to early or standard catheter removal was performed. Patients in the early arm were administered an α-antagonist (prazosin 1 mg oral) 6 hours before catheter removal.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the incidence of acute urinary retention.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients were randomly assigned to early (n = 71) or standard (n = 71) catheter removal. Mean age was 44.8 ± 16.9 years, and the study cohort included 54% men. The most common operations were IPAA (66%) and low anterior resection (18%). The overall rate of retention was 9.2% (n = 13), with no difference between early (n = 6; 8.5%) or standard (n = 7; 9.9%) catheter removal (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.30-2.42). The risk difference was -1.4% (95% CI, -8.3 to 11.1), confirming noninferiority. The rate of infection was significantly lower in early vs standard catheter removal (0% vs 11.3%; p = 0.01). Length of stay was significantly shorter after early vs standard catheter removal (4 days, interquartile range = 3-6 vs 5 days, interquartile range = 4-7; p = 0.03).
LIMITATIONS: Patients and investigators were not blinded; a nonselective oral α-antagonist was used.
CONCLUSIONS: Following pelvic colorectal surgery, early urinary catheter removal, when combined with the addition of an oral α-antagonist, is noninferior to standard urinary catheter removal and carries a lower risk of symptomatic infection and shorter hospital stay.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current lymph node (LN) staging for salivary gland cancer (SGC) is extrapolated from mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, given its unique biology and clinical behavior, it is possible that a SGC-specific LN staging system would be more accurate.
METHODS: Patients from the National Cancer Data Base with nonmetastatic SGC of the head and neck who were diagnosed from 2004 through 2013 and underwent surgical resection and neck dissection removing at least 10 LNs were included. Multivariable models were constructed to assess the association between survival and LN factors, including number of metastatic LNs, extranodal extension, LN size, and lower LN involvement.
RESULTS: Overall, 4520 patients met the inclusion criteria. An increasing number of metastatic LNs was found to be strongly associated with worse survival without plateau. The risk of death increased more rapidly up to 4 LNs (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.41 [P < .001]), and was more gradual for additional LNs >4 (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.03 [P < .001]). LN size, extranodal extension, and lower LN involvement appeared to have no impact on survival when accounting for the number of metastatic LNs. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to create a novel SGC LN staging system in which N0 indicates 0 positive LNs, N1 indicates 1 to 2 positive LNs, N2 indicates 3 to 21 positive LNs, and N3 indicates ≥ 22 positive LNs. This system exhibited greater concordance than the current American Joint Committee on Cancer (eighth edition) system.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative LN burden is an important determinant of survival in patients with SGC. Use of this variable may improve SGC staging. Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.},

METHODS: Patients from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) with HNSCC undergoing curative-intent resection, neck dissection, and postoperative radiation with positive margins or ENE were identified.
RESULTS: This analysis included 1199 patients aged ≥ 70 years with median follow-up of 42.6 months. Postoperative concurrent CRT was associated with improved overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.752; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.638-0.886) compared to radiation alone in multivariable analysis. Three-year OS was 52.4% with CRT versus 43.4% with radiation (P = .012) in propensity-score matched cohorts. The survival impact of CRT varied by N classification (P = .002 for interaction), with benefit seen only in those with N2 to N3 disease.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative concurrent CRT may benefit older patients with HNSCC with positive margins or ENE, particularly those with higher nodal burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health care consumers are increasingly using online ratings to select providers, but differences in the distribution of scores across specialties and skew of the data have the potential to mislead consumers about the interpretation of ratings.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to determine whether distributions of consumer ratings differ across specialties and to provide specialty-specific data to assist consumers and clinicians in interpreting ratings.
METHODS: We sampled 212,933 health care providers rated on the Healthgrades consumer ratings website, representing 29 medical specialties (n=128,678), 15 surgical specialties (n=72,531), and 6 allied health (nonmedical, nonnursing) professions (n=11,724) in the United States. We created boxplots depicting distributions and tested the normality of overall patient satisfaction scores. We then determined the specialty-specific percentile rank for scores across groupings of specialties and individual specialties.
RESULTS: Allied health providers had higher median overall satisfaction scores (4.5, interquartile range [IQR] 4.0-5.0) than physicians in medical specialties (4.0, IQR 3.3-4.5) and surgical specialties (4.2, IQR 3.6-4.6, P<.001). Overall satisfaction scores were highly left skewed (normal between -0.5 and 0.5) for all specialties, but skewness was greatest among allied health providers (-1.23, 95% CI -1.280 to -1.181), followed by surgical (-0.77, 95% CI -0.787 to -0.755) and medical specialties (-0.64, 95% CI -0.648 to -0.628). As a result of the skewness, the percentages of overall satisfaction scores less than 4 were only 23% for allied health, 37% for surgical specialties, and 50% for medical specialties. Percentile ranks for overall satisfaction scores varied across specialties; percentile ranks for scores of 2 (0.7%, 2.9%, 0.8%), 3 (5.8%, 16.6%, 8.1%), 4 (23.0%, 50.3%, 37.3%), and 5 (63.9%, 89.5%, 86.8%) differed for allied health, medical specialties, and surgical specialties, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Online consumer ratings of health care providers are highly left skewed, fall within narrow ranges, and differ by specialty, which precludes meaningful interpretation by health care consumers. Specialty-specific percentile ranks may help consumers to more meaningfully assess online physician ratings.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Definitive treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is challenging owing to its rarity, complicated regional anatomy, and the intensity of therapy. In contrast to other head and neck cancers, the effect of facility volume has not been well described for NPC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with stage II-IVB NPC diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 and treated with definitive radiation. Patients with incomplete staging, unknown receipt or timing of treatment, unknown follow-up duration, incomplete socioeconomic information, or treatment outside the reporting facility were excluded. High-volume facilities (HVFs) were defined as the top 5% of facilities according to the annual facility volume.
RESULTS: The present analysis included 3941 NPC patients treated at 804 facilities with a median follow-up duration of 59.4 months, including 1025 patients (26.0%) treated at HVFs. Treatment at HVFs was associated with significantly improved overall survival (OS) on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.90; P=.001). In propensity score-matched cohorts, 5-year OS was 69.1% versus 63.3% at HVFs versus lower volume facilities (LVFs), respectively (P=.003). Similar results were seen when facility volume was analyzed as a continuous variable. The effect of facility volume on survival varied by academic status (P=.002 for interaction). At academic centers, the propensity score-matched cohorts had 5-year OS of 71.4% compared with 62.4% (P<.001) at HVFs and LVFs, respectively. In contrast, the 5-year OS was 63.5% versus 67.9% (P=.68) in propensity score-matched patients at nonacademic HVFs and LVFs.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment at HVFs was associated with improved OS for patients with NPC, with the effect exclusively seen at academic centers.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is characterized by high rates of functional impairment, health care utilization, and associated costs. Research supports the use of comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment approaches. However, many hospitals hesitate to offer this full range of services, especially to Medi-Cal/Medicaid patients whose services are reimbursed at low rates. This cost analysis examines the effect on hospital and insurance costs of patients' enrollment in an interdisciplinary pediatric pain clinic, which includes medication management, psychotherapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, and massage. Retrospective hospital billing data (inpatient/emergency department/outpatient visits, and associated costs/reimbursement) from 191 consecutively enrolled Medi-Cal/Medicaid pediatric patients with chronic pain were used to compare 1-year costs before initiating pain clinic services with costs 1 year after. Pain clinic patients had significantly fewer emergency department visits, fewer inpatient stays, and lower associated billing, compared with the year before without interdisciplinary pain management services. Cost savings to the hospital of $36,228 per patient per year and to insurance of $11,482 per patient per year were found even after pain clinic service billing was included. Analyses of pre-pain clinic costs indicate that these cost reductions were likely because of clinic participation. Findings provide economic support for the use of interdisciplinary care to treat pediatric chronic pain on an outpatient basis from a hospital and insurance perspective.
This article presents a cost analysis of an interdisciplinary pediatric pain outpatient clinic. Findings support the incorporation of a comprehensive treatment approach that can reduce costs from a hospital and insurance perspective over the course of just 1 year.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that primary tumor ablation can improve survival for some cancer patients with distant metastases. This may be particularly applicable to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) because of its tropism for locoregional progression.
METHODS: This study included patients with metastatic HNSCC undergoing systemic therapy identified in the National Cancer Data Base. High-intensity local treatment was defined as radiation doses ≥ 60 Gy or oncologic resection of the primary tumor. Multivariate Cox regression, propensity score matching, landmark analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed to account for imbalances in covariates, including adjustments for the number and location of metastatic sites in the subset of patients with this information available.
RESULTS: In all, 3269 patients were included (median follow-up, 51.5 months). Patients undergoing systemic therapy with local treatment had improved survival in comparison with patients receiving systemic therapy alone in propensity score-matched cohorts (2-year overall survival, 34.2% vs 20.6%; P < .001). Improved survival was associated only with patients receiving high-intensity local treatment, whereas those receiving lower-intensity local treatment had survival similar to that of patients receiving systemic therapy without local treatment. The impact of high-intensity local therapy was time-dependent, with a stronger impact within the first 6 months after the diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.255; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.210-0.309; P < .001) in comparison with more than 6 months after the diagnosis (AHR, 0.622; 95% CI, 0.561-0.689; P < .001) in the multivariate analysis. A benefit was seen in all subgroups, in landmark analyses of 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivors, and when adjusting for the number and location of metastatic sites.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of head and neck cancers is complex and associated with significant morbidity, requiring multidisciplinary care and physician expertise. Thus, facility characteristics, such as clinical volume and academic status, may influence outcomes.
METHODS: The current study included 46,567 patients taken from the National Cancer Data Base who were diagnosed with locally advanced invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx and were undergoing definitive radiotherapy. High-volume facilities (HVFs) were defined as the top 1% of centers by the number of patients treated from 2004 through 2012. Multivariable Cox regression and propensity score matching were performed to account for imbalances in covariates.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 55.1 months. Treatment at a HVF (hazard ratio, 0.798; 95% confidence interval, 0.753-0.845 [P<.001]) and treatment at an academic facility (hazard ratio, 0.897; 95% confidence interval, 0.871-0.923 [P<.001]) were found to be independently associated with improved overall survival in multivariable analysis. In propensity score-matched cohorts, the 5-year overall survival rate was 61.6% versus 55.5% for patients treated at an HVF versus lower-volume facilities, respectively (P<.001). Similarly, the 5-year overall survival rate was 52.3% versus 49.7% for patients treated at academic versus nonacademic facilities (P<.001). Analysis of facility volume as a continuous variable demonstrated continual improvement in survival with an increased number of patients treated. The impact of facility volume and academic designation on survival was observed when using a variety of thresholds to define HVF, and across the vast majority of subgroups, including both oropharyngeal and nonoropharyngeal subsites.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who are undergoing curative radiotherapy at HVFs and academic centers appear to have improved survival. Cancer 2017;123:3933-42. © 2017 American Cancer Society.},
